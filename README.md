# laguerre_transformations
A library for visualising the mathematical transformations known as
Laguerre transformations. See
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laguerre_transformations) for more.

Laguerre transformations act on oriented lines in the plane. They don't
act on points.

Laguerre transformations are analogous to the Moebius transformations.
Both are representable by 2x2 matrices. The difference between them is that 
while Moebius transformations can naturally be represented by complex-numbered
matrices, Laguerre transformations can instead be represented by *dual-numbered*
matrices.

Examples:

```python
from laguerre_transformations import *

circle1 = make_circle((100,100),100)
circle2 = make_circle((50,50),-100)

transformation = dual_matrix(3,5,-1,3,9,-6,4,2)

animate_transformation(transformation,
                       circle1 + circle2,
                       offset=(200,200))
```

This snippet interpolates between the identity matrix and the given
transformation (represented as a dual number matrix), applies this sequence
of interpolated transformations to two circles, and then displays the result
as a GIF animation.

The result is:

Another example:

```python
from laguerre_transformations import *

grid = make_grid()

transformation = dual_matrix(3,5,-1,3,9,-6,4,2)

animate_transformation(transformation,
                       grid,
                       offset=(200,200))
```

This time, the same sequence of transformations are applied to a square grid.
Result: ![A grid undergoing a Laguerre transformation](examples/grid.gif)
